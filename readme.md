### Introduction

In this project, we developed an online book store example with C++. To be able to create this software, we used inheritance and polymorphism aspects of object oriented programming. We used Doxygen to present our project in a brief and more understandable way. Furthermore, in the programming process, to keep the teamwork efficient we used GitHub as a collaborative development environment.

### Design

The main purpose of the program is creating a user friendly platform for the users who will both perform managing and shopping operations over the products. So, we created abstract classes for products and payment methods. The crucial part of the program is shopping cart class which includes all shopping operations. Moreover, we used list library for using lists to keep products and customers; algorithm library to make searching operations in lists easier with lambda expressions. After completing the main requirements, we started the design of the main menu of the program that the user will directly interact. The parts of the main menu are designed according to the requirements of the object oriented programming.
	
Also, we added some cool features. Some of them are, detecting the card type from the first digits of the card number according to the predefined card types, informing the user about the whole process of shopping –like showing invoice, the product list…- with a well designed format.
